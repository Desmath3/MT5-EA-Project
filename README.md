# MT5 EA Project

## Description
This repository contains a collection of MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisors (EAs) developed for automated trading. These EAs implement specific trading strategies, including moving average-based systems, Fibonacci retracement levels, Bollinger Bands, and custom indicators. The project includes multiple versions and upgrades of each EA, such as:

- **EA BB 2025**: Based on the Bollinger Bands strategy.
- **MA ribbon**: Utilizes multiple moving averages for trend analysis.
- **MA Touch**: Triggers trades based on moving average crossovers or touches.
- **Fib Retracement**: Uses Fibonacci levels for entry and exit points.
- **SFP**: Implements a custom strategy defined by the developer.
- **Other versions**: Includes upgrades (e.g., v2, v3, v4, v5) and compiled `.ex5` files.

The EAs are written in MQL5 and compiled for use within the MetaTrader 5 platform. Development began in January 2023, with the initial release uploaded on October 15, 2023.
